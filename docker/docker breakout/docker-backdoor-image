below are the steps we can perform to backdoor docker image to take control of host machine

1. The attacker explores the AWS environment and discovers they are able to list ECR repositories using compromised AWS credentials.
2. The attacker finds that their target uses an NGINX Docker image and pulls that Docker image from ECR.
3. The attacker decides to create a reverse shell backdoor in the pulled NGINX Docker image.
This module generates a Dockerfile on the fly and builds new a Docker image from that file.
4. Finally, the attacker pushes the backdoored Docker image to ECR.
