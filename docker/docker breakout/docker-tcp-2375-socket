# Docker TCP socker(default 2375) used insted of unix socket
0.0.0.0:2375 - for remote use
127.0.0.1:2375 - for local use

In this scenario we will see that misconfigured docker with port 2375 running and exposed. We will use this with docker runtime host option to access the containers, images and gain host system privileges.

The Docker daemon can listen for Docker Engine API requests via three different types of Socket unix, tcp, and fd. To access remotely we have to enable tcp socket. The default setup provides un-encrypted and un-authenticated direct access to the Docker daemon. It is conventional to use port 2375 for un-encrypted, and port 2376 for encrypted communication with the daemon.

Step 1: 
Scan the 2375 and 2376 port using nmap from student VM
nmap -p 2375,2376 -n 192.168.56.4 -v

step 2:
We can query the docker API using curl
curl 192.168.56.4:2375/images/json | jq .

we can also run new containier with mount option to mount host system fs
